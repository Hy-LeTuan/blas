# BLAS: My own reimplementation of BLAS protocols

## Why reimplement BLAS?

With some recent tweaks in my Neovim configurations, I've been having an urge to code. I thought, what better way to familiarize myself with the new setup than to do a project where I get to write obscure function names and type malloc a dozen times.

All in all, since my Neovim config actually changes approximately 5 times a week, this project is just my motivation to finally learn Assembly.
